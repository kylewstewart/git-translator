# Three Word Fraiser
Ever found it hard to express yourself using mere words?
 Simply type 3 words and this app will suggest how you could get your message across in Gif form.

Made using the lovely open developer API from [Giphy](https://giphy.com/)

### Shuffle

Whenever you search the first Gif that comes back might not be the right one or it might not go well with the other Gifs in your phrase.

By shuffling you can checkout what else Giphy has to offer.

### Rank

The rank (Gold, Silver, Bronze) is a reflection of the Gifs people have picked to send.

We save a record of the most popular Gifs associated to a word and serve these up first to other users.

### Example

When people search for "big" they may want a picture of Tom Hanks (great movie) rather than a large object. We'll be able to capture this information
